		<p class="reportHeader">Web Technologies 2nd submission, Alex Parrott</p>
	
		<p>For this assignment I choose to create a site to showcase the work of a friend
		of mine, Tim Clough, who  is an aspiring photographer. As I am a conversion student my goal here is to demonstrate
		competance in all the major technologies taught (HTML, CSS, javascript) rather than showing off 
		higher level programming skills. Instead I focussed most of my time 
		teaching myself how to manipulate images in Gimp and animate them using Jquery. 
		I decided to use XHTML5 in order to be more forward thinking and also experiment
		wth some of the more interesting newer features of the language. All coding was done using Jedit. Although written
		in the first person under the guise of Tim, all the text was written by myself. All pages can be accessed from 
		the navigation bar on this page.</p>
	
		<p class="reportHeader">The Header &#38; Navigation Bar</p>
	
		<p>The header and navigation buttons (<em>Home, Gallery, Blog, Contact</em>)
		were all created using Gimp. I liked the idea of having road signs as navigation buttons.
		As the photographer in question is Bristol based I used a photograph of a Bristol road sign
		taken by the man himself:</p>
	
		<img src="./original_sign.png" height="100" alt="Original sign"/>
	
		<p>To make the main logo I carefully erased the original lettering and used the colour picker tool 
		to make the new blank space the same colour as the surrounding area. Then I simply
		added the text as a new layer, added a black and white gradient to make it look more
		like the original text and experimented with filters to give it a road sign look. Finally
		I changed the post code number 6 to a 2 (as BS2 is Tim's home postcode) using the same method.</p>
	
		<p>The navigation buttons were done in a similar way. However, first I had to I remove 
		the middle of the sign and the post code and then push the two new images together.
		I used various smudge and blending tools to hide the seam and give each sign slightly different 
		imperfections and blemishes.</p>
	
		<p>This replaces the old text version with dropdown menus used on my first submission. I 
		have set up the CSS so that the navigation buttons push down when they are clicked. This section as well
		as the footer containing by name are on all of the pages on the site (including this one).</p>
	
		<p class="reportHeader">The Home Page (home.html)</p>
	
		<p>This page is a simple text intro to the site. The main change from the first submission is the addition
		of a Javascript animated image slideshow which fades the various images into each other. This was my first
		attempt at javascript so the code was mostly a modified version of one found at 
		<a class="link" href="http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/simplest-jquery-slideshow">
		snook.ca</a>. The only changes I made were to the 
		variables controlling the fadein and out timings. To get these to work I also downloaded the Jquery libraries 
		which I have included unedited (<dfn>jquery.js</dfn>, the main library, and <dfn>jquery-ui.js</dfn>, an 
		additional plugin used by Kwicks on the blog page, see below).</p>
	
		<p class="reportHeader">The Gallery (gallery.html)</p>
	
		<p>Please note that I have only included this page in the zip version of the site. It is missing from the
		standard version due to the sub folder set up needed to make the embedded gallery work properly. Simply
		having everything in one folder would not work in this case. The gallery itself is an animated sldeshow
		showcasing Tim's photograghy. This framework was taken  from <a class="link" href="http://www.juicebox.net/">
		www.juicebox.net</a> and is a free download. I decided to use this to demonstrate ability 
		to integrate someone else's code into my own HTML. I generated the image gallery and their captions using 
		the Juicebox GUI which in turn created an XML file for the javascript to execute. The script entitled 
		<dfn>gallery.js</dfn> was the only script I edited myself to give the gallery the correct look needed to fit the 
		theme of the rest of the site (namely the colouring). The <dfn>juicebox.js</dfn> script was included unedited.</p>

		<p class="reportHeader">The Blog Page (blog.html)</p>
	
		<p>This page has three columns created in CSS by first making a left and right column and then sub-dividing 
		the right column into another two. I took this approach to avoid using the less supported CSS columns method.
		The two cartoon men ("Mac" on the left and "Swirly" on the right. Don't ask.) on this page were created using 
		Inkscape. The inspiration came from a similar graffiti image on a building on Nelson Street in downtown Bristol. 
		That's the painted gent in the image here if you are interested.<img class="inspire" src="./inspiration.png" 
		height="350" alt="original swirly dude"/></p>
	
		<p>The main outline and shapes were created as a simple SVG. Standard outline shapes were created first and then 
		the cut path tool to remove areas of overlap. After this, lines and curves were added to make arms and legs. 
		Finally, a filter in Gimp was added to give the images a more hand drawn cartoon vibe. A third man (a copy of 
		Swirly, on the right, but with a red face) was created in Gimp so that when the mouse is over the original image, 
		his face turns red. This is a simple illusion created by toggling between the two different images whenver the 
		mouse is over the image. This effect was created using a script that I wrote using the Jquery library (the source 
		code for this can be found in the <dfn>vert_accordion.js</dfn> file).</p>
	
		<p>The centre column of this page is an animated Jquery accordion. Within the accordion I have embedded an image 
		slider which I adapted from the Kwicks Jquery plugin (taken from 
		<a class="link" href="http://www.jeremymartin.name/projects.php?project=kwicks">www.jeremymartin.name</a>).
		The code that I wrote for these can also be found in the <dfn>vert_accordion.js</dfn> file. The first function
		for the Jquery accordion I wrote myself using the Jquery website for quidance (<a class="link" href="http://www.jquery.com">
		jquery.com</a>). The second function was taken from the aforementioned kwicks site and I simply changed the variables
		(the size of images and how far the slider opens). The final function for toggling the images was written from scratch
		(using the jquery and <a class="link" href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3schools</a> site for guidance). Finally, the 
		<dfn>jquery.kwicks-1.5.1.js</dfn> file was used unedited.</p> 
	
		<p>I also decided to experiment with the HTML5 video tag on this page which is in the "Time Lapsed" section of the accordion.
		My HTML code makes reference to a .ogv and .webm versions of the video. This was included so that different
		browers could play the video. However, I have only uploaded one version (the .mov version) to SAFE. The file sizes are fairly
		large but the content is exactly the same on all three versions so I deliberately left the copies out. Therefore, this content 
		will only display in Chrome or Safari. A blank video play will display in the other browsers. Obvsiously for this site to go live 
		I would need to include the other two versions on the server.</p>
	
		<p class="reportHeader">Contact Page (contact.html)</p>
	
		<p>The contact form was created entirely using CSS. I wanted to avoid javascript in this case to illustrate skill 
		in CSS instead. The code all written from scratch except the contact form send button which was taken from 
		<a class="link" href="http://www.red-team-design.com/html5-css3-envelope-contact-form">
		www.red-team-design.com</a> and modified to fit in with the theme of my site. 
		This form is pure CSS, I have not included a PHP file to validate or action it.
		Therefore, when you click send the page simply refreshes. I left the PHP out as it falls into the server side which we have not
		covered yet and I wanted to focus on showing competance in what has been featured in the lectures.</p>
	
		<p>I used the image of the telephone box on this page as I felt it fit in with 
		the city based theme of the site. This image was cut out and rendered 
		using Gimp.</p>
	
		<p class="reportHeader">Testing</p>
	
		<p>All pages were validated using Total Validator using the HTML5 polyglot standard. These were
		then converted to .xhtml files and tested successfully on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and
		Internet Explorer 9. My CSS was also validated using the W3 CSS validator. Testing did reveal that download time was too
		slow so I used Gimp and ImageOptim (a PNG compressor) to scale down the size of my images.</p>
	
		<p>I am pleased with the look of the site and the fact that the photographer in question is also very satisfied with the 
		result which he hopes to use after I have the marks back. I am particularly happy with the logo which took quite some time to make 
		look realistic. For some reason I have a strange love for the two cartoon men aswell. The first man started simply as an experiment but the more
		time I spent on him the more attached I became... The blog page is the page I spent the most time on and equally is the page that 
		I am most pleased with.</p>
